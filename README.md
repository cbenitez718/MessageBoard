# MessageBoard
A PHP message board lets users post messages with subject, name, and message fields, plus 'Post message' and 'Reset form' buttons. 'View messages' lets you see posted messages. Other options include posting new messages, sorting subjects, removing duplicates, and deleting individual or first and last messages.
